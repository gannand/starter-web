Cheeseburgers make your knees weak and your soul tingle.

A great cheeseburger is a gastronomical event with so many varieties you couldn’t get tired of it if you tried.

There’s cheesy incarnation waiting for you no matter what your palate preferences are.

Unless you’re vegan, in which case we’re sorry for your loss.

They say you’re never supposed to meet your idols. In this case, it’s a good thing your idol is inanimate.

Cheeseburgers are never going to give you up or let you down. They’ll also never run around or desert you.

They’ll never make you cry, unless it’s from sheer joy. Cheeseburgers certainly won’t say goodbye either.

Finally, cheeseburgers are incapable of telling lies or hurting you. On the flip side, they can still Rick Roll you.
Epic cheeseburgers come in all kinds of manifestations, but we want them in and around our mouth no matter what. Slide those smashed patties with the gently caramelized meat fat between a toasted brioche bun and pass it over. You fall in love with the cheeseburger itself but the journey ain’t half bad either.
